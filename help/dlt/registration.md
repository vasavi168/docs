# DLT Template Registration Process 

The Template registration process involves 2 parts:

## Consent Registration
 This involves collection of consent of the end customer to send future communication to them regarding the services being enrolled to. This works like an “Opt-In” message.
## Content Registration
 This template is for the messages that you intend to send out to your clients. This can be OTP, Transactional or Marketing, depending on the content you intend on pushing.

Depending on the content of the message, the type of template should be selected at the time of uploading.

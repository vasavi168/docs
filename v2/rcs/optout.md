# OPTOUT

RCS campaigns specifically target customers who are registered subscribers to your RCS services. To manage customer preferences, our opt-out feature allows you to block a customer's number. Once a number is blocked, any attempt to trigger an RCS message to that customer will be automatically rejected by our system. As a result, the customer will not receive the RCS message. This feature ensures that customer preferences are respected and allows for effective communication management.

# SMPP Gateway

The SMPP (Short Message Peer-to-Peer) Gateway is a protocol utilized by the telecommunications industry for seamless exchange of SMS messages between Short Message Service Centers (SMSC) and External Short Messaging Entities (ESME). The SMPP protocol is transmitted via TCP/IP, enabling swift and efficient delivery of SMS messages.

## INTRODUCTION

The Messaging Platform employs the SMPP v3.4 Protocol Specification Issue 1.5. It is worth noting that our platform is designed to maintain backward compatibility with SMPP v3.3. Therefore, it is recommended to refer to both this document and the SMPP v3.4 Specification v1.5 to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the functionality and features associated with SMPP. Prior familiarity with SMPP is assumed while reading this documentation.

## SERVER LIST

{app} has multiple SMPP servers for you to connect to. Each SMPP server offers the ability to connect to it via the regular (plaintext) method or via a TLS1.0 or better connection.

Here is an overview of the available servers:

| Hostname            | Port |
| ------------------- | ---- |
| smpp1.{smpp_domain} | 3634 |
| smpp2.{smpp_domain} | 3634 |

## Additional TLV (For Indian Routes)

| Mandatory TLV          | Tag value Decimal | Tag value Hex |
| ---------------------- | ----------------- | ------------- |
| PE_ID                  | 5120              | 1400          |
| Template_ID            | 5121              | 1401          |
| Telemarketer_ID(TM_ID) | 51212             | 1402          |

## CONNECTIVITY

Clients may connect to the Messaging Platform Server multiple numbers of times. This may be of importance if the client wishes to deploy multiple applications simultaneously. To connect to the platform, one needs to specify the following parameters:

**IP Address and Port:**
This is the TCP/IP endpoint on which the ESME should connect to the platform.

**Username:**
This is the username (`system_id`) of your account configured on the Platform

**Password:**
Password for the above account. Required for security reasons to prevent unauthorized access to your account.

**System_type:**
Set the system_type field to `smpp`.

**Interface_version:**
The client application should connect with the interface_version field set to 0x34 (52 decimal), if it is using SMPP v3.4, otherwise the Platformassumes that the application uses SMPP v3.3.

**enquire_link:** The application should issue an enquire_link every minute. This will
ensure the link stays active even when it is not in use. The Messaging Platform will automatically disconnect any link which is inactive for more than 5mins.

## BINDINGS AND THROUGHPUT

Upon setting up an SMPP account for you, you will receive the maximum number of allowed binds and a designated maximum throughput. Typically, these values may be set to something like 3 binds and 50 messages per second.

It's worth noting that these values are enforced on a per-server basis. In the example mentioned above, you can establish a total of 9 binds and achieve a combined throughput of 150 messages per second when connecting to all servers.

Please be aware that for maintenance purposes, we can only guarantee the availability of one server at any given time. Therefore, we strongly advise connecting to all servers to ensure uninterrupted service.

## BINDINGS AND RELAYING

{app} Alerts employs a message relaying system that is connection and server agnostic. This means that when you send an MT message via a `submit_sm` PDU on connection A, you may receive the corresponding DLR in the form of a `deliver_sm` on connection B, given that both connections are bound with the same username.

Importantly, this holds true even if the connections are established with different servers. For example, if connection A is made to the smpp01 server and connection B to the smpp02 server, the scenario described above would still apply.

## SUBMITTING MESSAGES

#### Submission Types:

Messages may be submitted with either `submit_sm` or `data_sm`, using either the
short_message or message_payload fields. The message length may not exceed the
byte limit for the network that the message is being sent to (for example 140 bytes
on GSM networks).

The Platform does not support submit_multi. If the same message has to be sent to multiple destinations, each message must be sent separately.

Concatenated messages are supported by using the User Data Header (UDH), which is included in the message size byte limit.

#### Submit Responses

A positive response to a `submit` will contain an error code of zero and a non-null message reference.

A negative response will contain a vendor specific error code. The complete set of SMPP Error Codes and their associated values are defined in the following table.

| Error Number | Error Name              | Error Description                                  |

### Character Sets, Class and Data Coding

The Messaging Platform supports the following two types of data coding schemes: - GSM 03.38 Encoding (default) - Latin 1 (ISO-8859-1) encoding

The default character set is GSM 338. Although for data_coding=1 the character set GSM 03.38 is supported it is NOT RECOMMENDED, as it is known to cause problems with character encoding. Please set data_coding = 3 for ISO-8859-1(if and only if told so explicitly) encoded messages and data_coding=0 for GSM 03.38 encoded messages.

For Unicode messages you have to set data_coding = 8 and the message is expected in UTF-16 Big Endean format.

### Delivery Reports

The Messaging Platform will return a delivery report (Intermediate and/or final depending on the route) for a specific message to the client application when the registered_delivery field, while submitting the message, is set to 1. In order
to retrieve the delivery report from our server the client will have to connect to the Messaging Platform in the receiver or transceiver mode

Status and error code which can be returned by Messaging Platform.

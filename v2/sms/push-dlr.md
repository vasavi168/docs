# PUSH DLR

The DLR Push API sends the delivery report of the sent message to the client’s Webhok URL using `POST` method. [create here](/webhooks)

To request such delivery reports, first you need to create the Webhook in webhooks Section.
Then you will get `id` for the webhook you created.

`wehook_id` parameter in the API URL with any below mentioned replacable variables.

- The response codes other than 200 or 202 are not taken into consideration and requests for such response codes are considered as failed.

#### WEBHOOK (OR) CALLBACK URL

The WEBHOOK Push API sends the report of the Click2Call to the client’s URL in `POST` method.

To request such reports, you need to create webhook URL first in Webhooks section. Then pass that particular `webhook_id` you created earlier while making a call through API.

We will send a `POST` with json format to your webhook URL with below parameters
